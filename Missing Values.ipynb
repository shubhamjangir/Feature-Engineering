    "MAR data — means there is a systematic(logical) relationship between the propensity of missing values and the observed data, but not the missing data. What it means, is that the missingness of data can be predicted by other features in the dataset. Still confused? Fear not. In the table above you can see that the mileage has few missing values. If we analyze the dataset we can see that the manufacturing year of cars with missing values is lower than in other examples.\n",

    "Above, you can see the illustration that was made from real data in one of my previous projects. You can clearly see the correlation between the percentage of missing values in the mileage column and the manufacturing year of the car. From the illustration, we can assume that the older the car, the more the probability that the mileage will not be provided by the seller of the car. There can be a lot of reasons to not provide mileage for the old car, but the most important reason is — old cars have more mileage than the new ones. And the more the mileage is, the more the car has been used, which greatly affects its price. So, the long story short, we can predict the missingness of the mileage of the car, from its manufacturing year.\n",

    "Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)\n",
    "MCAR means there is no relationship between the missingness of the data and any values, observed or missing. This kind of missing values is the easiest to understand. The fact that the data is missing has nothing to do neither with observed data nor with non-observed data, it’s just missing. There is no logic in it. From the illustration provided above, we can see that there is missing value in the color column, there can be a lot of reasons for its missingness, but not the systematic(logical) one. Someone just forgot to mention the color, someone was lazy to do it, maybe it was a problem with a system, nothing serious here.\n",

    "Missing completely at random (MCAR). When data are MCAR, the fact that the data are missing is independent of the observed and unobserved data. In other words, no systematic differences exist between participants with missing data and those with complete data. For example, some participants may have missing laboratory values because a batch of lab samples was processed improperly. In these instances, the missing data reduce the analyzable population of the study and consequently, the statistical power, but do not introduce bias: when data are MCAR, the data which remain can be considered a simple random sample of the full data set of interest. MCAR is generally regarded as a strong and often unrealistic assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing at random (MAR). When data are MAR, the fact that the data are missing is systematically related to the observed but not the unobserved data. For example, a registry examining depression may encounter data that are MAR if male participants are less likely to complete a survey about depression severity than female participants. That is, if probability of completion of the survey is related to their sex (which is fully observed) but not the severity of their depression, then the data may be regarded as MAR. Complete case analyses, which are based on only observations for which all relevant data are present and no fields are missing, of a data set containing MAR data may or may not result in bias. If the complete case analysis is biased, however, proper accounting for the known factors (in the above example, sex) can produce unbiased results in analysis.\n",

    "Missing not at random (MNAR). When data are MNAR, the fact that the data are missing is systematically related to the unobserved data, that is, the missingness is related to events or factors which are not measured by the researcher. To extend the previous example, the depression registry may encounter data that are MNAR if participants with severe depression are more likely to refuse to complete the survey about depression severity. As with MAR data, complete case analysis of a data set containing MNAR data may or may not result in bias; if the complete case analysis is biased, however, the fact that the sources of missing data are themselves unmeasured means that (in general) this issue cannot be addressed in analysis and the estimate of effect will likely be biased."
